# Kitchin & Anderson Response

## Question:
Anderson describes what he calls the "death of theory?" What did he mean by this statement? In response Kitchin offers a rebuttal to Anderson. What do you think? Has big data killed theory?

## Response:
Anderson describes what he calls the "death of theory". He made this statement due to the development of data in today's world. He said this because he believes that the use of data now is completely different and has surpassed the use of "theory". He uses the example of Google, and how their founding philosophy is "we don't know why this page is better than that one".  According to the article, Google uses statistics of incoming links and data to match things such as ads to content or results to searches.
